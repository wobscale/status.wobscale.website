## Past incidents

### Router update (2018-08-14)

SIX requested we apply an ARP configuration change to our router. Since this required rebooting anyways, we also updated OpenBSD.

The operation went off with no unexpected difficulties, resulting in around 10
minutes of network downtime as the router rebooted.

### Upstream carrier maintenance (2017-05-18)

Our upstream carrier, Hurricane Electric, had planned maintenance that we were not notified about.

We are currently reviewing options for a backup transit provider.
