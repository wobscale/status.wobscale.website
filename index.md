## Past incidents

### Wobscale.chat downtime (2018-09-05)

Due to an operator error, the downtime planned for wobscale.chat did not occur. The [&nbsp;Ｃｒｉｔｉｃａｌ Ｓｅｃｕｒｉｔｙ Ｕｐｄａｔｅ&nbsp;](https://matrix.org/blog/2018/09/06/critical-security-update-synapse-0-33-3-1/) was applied a few short hours after release, and we have no evidence the security of any Wobscale users was impacted by those specific vulnerabilities.

### Router update (2018-08-14)

SIX requested we apply an ARP configuration change to our router. Since this required rebooting anyways, we also updated OpenBSD.

The operation went off with no unexpected difficulties, resulting in around 10
minutes of network downtime as the router rebooted.
