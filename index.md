## Upcoming maintenance windows

### Power maintenance, 2018-11-01 15:00 &ndash; 2018-11-02 00:00 UTC

Our colocation provider (IsoFusion) "will be performing routine power maintenance". We expect no impact but recommend against performing critical changes during this time.

### Cogent transit maintenance window, 2018-11-09 08:00 &ndash; 14:00 UTC

Our backup transit provider (Cogent) "will be doing upgrades to their core routing devices" in the Seattle metro area. We expect no impact but recommend against performing critical changes during this time.

Cogent is our lowest-preference route in our router and is AS-prefixed 3 times on our route announcements. Traffic previously transiting via Cogent will almost certainly transit over Hurricane Electric during the maintenance.
