## System status

### Significant packet loss, starting 2021-02-08

Wob engineers have been debugging a significant packet loss issue that we noticed starting Tuesday, February 8.

The issue appears to be worsening, so we are bringing down all our peering sessions on the SIX. All traffic will be going via our Cogent backup transit (limited to 100 Mbps).
